	\section{Project Issues}
		\subsection{Open Issues}
		\indent The only know open issue is the possibility of the graphics library provided by the open source project being unusable. Otherwise there aren't any forcable issues because the team has permission to use the existing.\\
		\indent TPython includes a lot of built-in libraries that will be used in the implementation. One such library is Tkinter, used for the graphical portion of the product.\\
		\indent The existing implementation PySolFC is an off-the-shelf solution, and so is the project that PySolFC was based upon, the original PySol.\\
		\subsection{New Problems}
		\indent Any changes to the original PySol graphics library that would make it not usable for our reimplementation would affect the work of the developers. They would then have to recreate the graphics library. The program should not require a lot of RAM when it’s running or take up too much space on the user’s system. The project should not over power the servers or over consume power.\\
		\subsection{Tasks}
		\indent The team plan on completing this project by completely problem statement and requirements documents before beginning programming. With these documents the team will have a strong understanding of what needs to done. From then on developers will start creating the program using the Model View Controller method and referring to the open sourced project when needed. To manage the project we’ll be using version control with git. \\


		\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
		\indent No real requirements for migration as we plan to deliver as a standalone executable. Packaging (bundling) as a standalone executable allows the product to be self-contained with minimal external dependencies.\\
		\indent However, the existing implementation if installed adds its modules to a python directory for 3rd party packages. This will need to be reversed and/or the new files written to the same directory.\\

		\subsection{Risks}
		\begin{itemize}
			\itemsep0em
			\item Excessive pressure due to time constraints for deliverables
			\item Inaccurate quantification of objectives
			\item Inadequate testing of graphical user interface
		\end{itemize}

		\subsection{Costs}
		\indent The product being developed is open-source as is the implementation it is based upon. To follow and propagate the concept of open-source software, only freely available software shall be used in the development process. \\
		\indent The primary and only significant cost of the project is the time and effort spent by its developers. The cost is anticipated to be 5 hours or more of time spent per person per week for the duration of September-December 2016.\\

		\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
		\indent In-person training will not be required and therefore will not be provided for this product. However, user documentation will be included with the packaged product. A specifications document including APIs, modular decomposition, and also build & modification instructions shall accompany the source for the product.\\
 		\indent The user documentation shall provide enough guidance that a user with no previous exposure to the product shall after reading be able to achieve basic objectives. These objectives include but are not limited to navigating the interface, starting a new game, and accessing the demo feature.\\
 		\indent The user documentation shall include a section (or multiple sections) that display the rules of the available games.

		\subsection{Waiting Room}
		\indent Some possible requirements we could address if time permits:\\
		Create more games (version 1.1) \\
		By creating more games users will have more options and be less likely to get bored. \\
		Improve the graphics (version 1.1) \\
		By improving the graphics, the program will avoid the risk of seeming outdated \\
		Create a leaderboard (version 1.2)\\
		By creating a leaderboard, it will keep people more engaged and bring out their competitiveness which will insure that they use the program more. \\
