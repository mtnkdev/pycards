		\subsection{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}
		
		\textbf{Relevant Facts}
		\vspace{-2mm}
		\begin{itemize}
			\itemsep0em
			\item The existing implementation is implemented purely in 
			the Python programming language.
			\item Mac OSX and Ubuntu come with a Python environment 
			pre-installed. The installed version may or may not be compatible 
			with 
			the product.
		\end{itemize}
		\textbf{Assumptions}
		\vspace{-2mm}
		\begin{itemize}
			\itemsep0em
			\item 	It is not feasible for the product to be tested for 
			compatibility on all of the various operating systems. As such it 
			will only be tested on the latest version of each major operating 
			system as previously specified.
			\item The product assumes that the system that it will be operated 
			on includes peripherals such as a mouse, keyboard and display.
		\end{itemize}
		
	\section{Functional Requirements}
		\subsection*{The Scope of the Work and the Product}
		\subsection{The Current Situation}
		\indent There already exists an implementation that has a similar purpose as
		that of our product, namely PySol Fan Club Edition. This implementation was
		coded entirely in Python and is an open-source software product.\\
		\subsection{The Context of the Work}
		\indent Our product shall be based upon the implementation PySol Fan Club
		Edition however it shall be redeveloped in order to satisfy the constraints
		and requirements defined in this document.\\

			\item Users will interact with the product using a mouse and 
			keyboard connected to their computer
		\end{itemize}
		\subsection{Installability Requirements}
		\begin{itemize}
			\itemsep0em
			\item The game will not need to be installed to the user's device; instead
			it will be packaged and self-contained, runnable as a portable application.
		\end{itemize}
		\subsection{Maintainability and Support Requirements}
		\begin{itemize}
			\itemsep0em
			\item The product is expected to run on Windows 10, Mac OSX, and 
			Ubuntu systems that have Python version \PYVER installed.
		\end{itemize}
		\subsection{Security Requirements}
		\begin{itemize}
			\itemsep0em
			\item The source code for the product is publicly available and as such
			anyone can download, modify, and produce modified version of the project.
			However, only the developer team is allowed to directly make changes to the 
			repository
			\item When the product is made ready for distribution, the packaged product
			shall have a checksum (ie. MD5 checksum) for verifying authenticity
		\end{itemize}
		\subsection{Cultural Requirements}
		\begin{itemize}
			\itemsep0em
			\item The product will not contain images or text that would be 
			considered offensive to residents of North America.
		\end{itemize}
		\subsection{Legal Requirements}
		\begin{itemize}
			\itemsep0em
			\item The product is licensed under the GNU GPLv3 license and must 
			conform to the license and any non-permissive terms added in 
			accordance to section 7 of the GNU GPLv3 license.
		\end{itemize}
		\subsection{Health and Safety Requirements}
		\begin{itemize}
			\itemsep0em
			\item This product requires the use of a pointing device and that the user
			views and interacts with a graphical user interface. Excessive use of this
			product may cause strain or injury including but not limited to eye strain
			and injury to arms, wrists, and/or hands including carpal tunnel syndrome.
		\end{itemize}
		
	\section{Project Issues}
		\subsection{Open Issues}
		\begin{itemize}
		\itemsep0em	
			\item The main open issue is the possibility of the graphics extension
			provided by the open source project being incompatible. Seeing as the team
			has permission to use and modify the existing implementation, many of the
			issues a new project would face have been accounted for
			\item Python includes a lot of built-in libraries that will be used in the
			 implementation. One such library is Tkinter, used for the graphical portion
			of the product
			\item The existing implementation PySolFC is an off-the-shelf solution,
			and so is the project that PySolFC was based upon, the original PySol
		\end{itemize}
		\subsection{New Problems}
		\begin{itemize}
		\itemsep0em	
			\item Any changes to the original Tkinter graphics library or the 
			custom interfaces that PySolFC provides to the library could make it
			incompatible with our reimplementation and would thusly affect the work of
			our developer team. It would require the adaptation of our code to the new
			API which could introduce problems
			\item The program should not require a lot of RAM when itâ€™s running or
			have high disk usage or requirements of the userâ€™s system. Overall the
			project should not have overly high resource consumption on the target system\\
		\end{itemize}
		\subsection{Tasks}
			\indent The team plan on completing this project by completing the problem
			statement and requirements documents before beginning programming. With these
			documents the team will have a strong understanding of what needs to done.
			From then onwards developers will work on implementing the program using
			the Model View Controller software architecture and referring to the existing
			project if and when needed. To manage the project weâ€™ll be using version
			control via git.\\


		\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
			\indent There are no major requirements for migration as we intend to
			distribute the program as a standalone executable (while making the source
			available to interested parties). As such the product will be able to coexist
			with the existing products PySol and PySolFC. Furthermore, packaging
			or bundling as an executable (or application) allows the product to be
			self-contained with minimal external dependencies.\\
			\indent The existing implementation however, if installed, adds its modules
			to the python directory for 3rd party packages. Facilitating its removal
			would require us to reverse that modification and by removing or updating
			the specified files\\

		\subsection{Risks}
		\begin{itemize}
			\itemsep0em
			\item Excessive pressure due to time constraints for deliverables
			\item Inaccurate quantification of objectives
			\item Inadequate testing of graphical user interface
		\end{itemize}

		\subsection{Costs}
			\indent The product being developed is open-source as is the implementation
			it is based upon. To follow and propagate the concept of open-source
			software, only freely available software shall be used in the development
			process.\\
			\indent The primary and only significant cost of the project to date is the
			time and effort spent by its developers. The cost is anticipated to be around
			5 hours or more of time spent per person per week for the duration of
			September-December 2016.\\

		\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
			\indent In-person training will not be required and therefore will not be
			provided for this product. However, user documentation will be included with
			the packaged product. A specifications document including APIs, modular
			decomposition, and also build and modification instructions shall accompany
			the source for the product.\\
	 		\indent The user documentation shall provide enough guidance that a user
			with no previous exposure to the product shall after reading be able to
			achieve basic objectives. These objectives include but are not limited to
			navigating the interface, starting a new game, and accessing the demo
			feature.\\
	 		\indent The user documentation shall include a section (or multiple
			sections) that display the rules of the available games.

		\subsection{Waiting Room}		
		\indent Some possible requirements we could address if time permits:\\
		\begin{itemize}
			\itemsep0em
			\item Create more games (version 1.1)\\
			By creating more games users will have more options and be less likely to
			become bored or disinterested
			\item Improve the graphics (version 1.1) \\
			By improving the graphics, the program will avoid the risk of seeming
			outdated or becoming obsolete
			\item Create a leaderboard (version 1.2)\\
			By creating a leaderboard, it will keep people more engaged and bring out
			their competitiveness which will motivate them to use the product more
