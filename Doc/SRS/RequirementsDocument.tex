		\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
		\indent \indent PyCards is a collection of solitaire 
		(single-player) card games. It is designed to be a source of 
		entertainment for the end 
		user(s). The main objective for the product is to PyCards to be a 
		user-friendly application that our users can use to pass the time, have 
		fun, relax, and also challenge themselves.
	\subsection{The Stakeholders}
		The Client\\
		The Customers\\
		Other Stakeholders
	\subsection{Mandated Restraints}
		\textbf{Constraint 1}\\
		\indent The source code of the application shall be implemented 
		using the Python programming language, version 2.7.xx.\\
		\textbf{Rationale 1}\\
		\indent The product should preserve compatibility for existing users of 
		the original implementation. The client should not be required to 
		upgrade or install new software in order to run the application.\\
		\textbf{Fit Criterion}\\
		\indent The product shall only require a Python interpreter 
		(and/or the inclusion of additional Python packages) in order to 
		operate. Exception will be made if either the entirety of the product 
		is ported to another language or if the necessary runtimes and 
		dependencies can be bundled with the product.\\\\
		
		\noindent \textbf{Constraint 2}\\
		\indent The product shall be compatible with Windows operating systems 
		(Windows 10), Mac OSX, and Ubuntu provided that Python version 2.7.xx 
		is compatible with the target system.\\
		\textbf{Rationale 2}\\
		\indent The client should not be required to migrate to newer (or 
		different) software or hardware in order to utilize the product.\\
		\textbf{Fit Criterion}\\
		\indent The product shall be tested on each of the specified systems by 
		the developers to ensure that it operates as expected and is fully 
		functional.\\\\
		
		\noindent \textbf {Constraint 3}\\
		\indent The product shall be made available under the GNU GPLv3 or 
		later, along with any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 
		7 of the GNU GPLv3.\\
		\textbf {Rationale 3}\\
		\indent The original implementation was conveyed with this license and 
		as per 
		the conditions modified source versions must be licensed under the same 
		license.\\
		\textbf {Fit Criterion}\\
		\indent The product must adhere to the conditions of the GNU GPLv3 
		license.\\\\
		
		\noindent \textbf {Constraint 4}\\
		\indent The source code for the product shall be publicly available but 
		the end product must also be deliverable as an standalone executable or 
		application for both Windows operating systems and Mac OSX operating 
		system.\\
		\textbf {Rationale 4}\\
		\indent The source code for the product must be publicly available as 
		per the conditions of the license. Users should not be required to be 
		familiar with the command-line/terminal in order to operate the 
		product.\\
		\textbf {Fit Criterion}\\
		\indent The final product should be available as a .exe executable for 
		Windows-based systems and as an application for OSX systems. The code 
		should be available in a publicly accessible repository.\\

		\subsection{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}
		
		\textbf{Relevant Facts}
		\vspace{-2mm}
		\begin{itemize}
			\itemsep0em
			\item The existing implementation is implemented purely in 
			the Python programming language.
			\item Mac OSX and Ubuntu come with a Python environment 
			pre-installed. The installed version may or may not be compatible 
			with 
			the product.
		\end{itemize}
		\textbf{Assumptions}
		\vspace{-2mm}
		\begin{itemize}
			\itemsep0em
			\item 	It is not feasible for the product to be tested for 
			compatibility on all of the various operating systems. As such it 
			will only be tested on the latest version of each major operating 
			system as previously specified.
			\item The product assumes that the system that it will be operated 
			on includes peripherals such as a mouse, keyboard and display.
