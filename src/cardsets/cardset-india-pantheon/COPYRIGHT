The court cards and Aces in this set were hand painted in India
by an unknown card maker some time in the late nineteenth century.
Some of the elements are similar to those found in Ganjifa cards
and it seems likely that the painter(s) were familiar with that
type of cards.  Two interesting features of this deck are that
the Hearts are inverted and that the courts and Aces have numbers
rather than the more familiar letters.
