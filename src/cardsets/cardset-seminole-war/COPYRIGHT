The court cards in this card set were originally published in 1819
by card maker J.Y. Humphreys of Philadelphia.  This is the earliest
known U. S. made "No Revoke" deck which means that each of the suits
has a different color.  In the original deck the Native American
chiefs were the Jacks.  But they were here first weren't they?  The
original back for this pack was unavailable.  The back chosen is a
late 19th century photograph of Chief White Buffalo.
