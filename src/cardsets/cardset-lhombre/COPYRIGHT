The court cards and Aces in this card set were published by
B. Dondorf of Frankfurt Germany in 1890.  The proper name for
the deck is l'Hombre but it is also known as the Sphinx deck.
The deck was published with the blue and rust colored backs.
The third back in this reproduction is actually one of the
boxes the pack was sold in.
