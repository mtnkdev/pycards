 Rangoon is a game of solitaire with all of the 52 cards faced up.
 Though all the cards are shown, and in spite of its simple rules
 it is a challenge to find the strategy to complete a game.

 After shuffling the deck, the cards will be laid down face up in
 four rows of 13 cards each.  Subsequently the kings are taken up,
 and put down in front of the rows.
 The object is to rearrange the cards such that each row contains
 one complete family (the cards of a suit in the correct ranking:
 King, Queen, Jack, Ten, ...., Three, Two, Ace).
 Rearranging is done  by using the four vacant places  which were
 created by moving the kings to the front. A card can be moved to
 a gap, provided the card is ranked with the card in front of the
 gap ( e.g. the 6 of spades can be moved behind the 7 of spades).
 By moving another gap emerges,  which can be used to move a card
 to, and so on.  The game is over when all gaps are behind an Ace
 or behind another gap, so no more card can be moved.
 This solitaire enjoys some popularity in the Netherlands, and is
 known under various names and in various flavors. The program of
 Rangoon supports a number of variants.

 The look-alike games known as "Montana Aces" (where the gaps are
 created by removing the aces)  and  "Gaps" (often with less than
 52 cards) are also supported by the program.

 I am releasing this as "POSTCARDWARE",  which means you are free
 to use the program.  And, when YOU think the program is worth it,
 express your appreciation by sending  a picture postcard  to the
 address at the bottom of this file.
 Being a collector of lighthouse postcards, my preference goes to
 a postcard of a lighthouse. But - of course - I would be pleased
 just as much with a postcard from your hometown.

 You are allowed to distribute -please do- this package,  as long
 as you (a) include this documentation file with the package when

 You are also allowed  to use the title-screen or screen-shots of
 the program for the purpose of promoting the program.

 You are not allowed to distribute this program  on disk or other

 You should  also be  aware that there are  bad people out  there

 trojan horses,  etc. before you run it,  don't blame me if there
 is one.  Basically, run this program at your own risk.


 [ history ]

 Because it was -and still is- my  favourite game of solitaire, I
 wrote a program for it way back in 1983 (coded in basic and 8080
 assembler for the DAI).  In 1984 I ported the program to GWBasic
 on a XT, but neither the graphics nor  the performance were at a
 level  sufficient  to release  the program.  The introduction of
 Visual Basic gave me  the  opportunity to  write a program  with
 a satisfactory look and performance,  and also get some exercise
 in what turned out to be a fine development environment.
 Because Rangoon is developed in Visual Basic the program must be
 run under MicroSoft Windows,  and does need the run-time package
 VBRUN200.DLL.


 [ installation ]

 Copy  the following files  onto your hard disc in a directory of
 your choice (e.g. c:\windows\wingames\rangoon):
     rangoon.exe, rangoon.hlp,
     ran41x41.bmp, ran41x55.bmp, ran51x69.bmp, ran61x85.bmp
     raninfo.txt, ranhist.txt, ranprob.txt, upgrade.txt
     cmdialog.vbx

 To run the program for a first introduction, type:
     cd <owndir>
     win rangoon

 To install the game start windows, go to the Program Manager and
 choose  F[ile] / N[ew..] / Program-item, and fill in the form:
     Description : rangoon
     Command Line: rangoon.exe
     Working Directory: <owndir>

 If you do not want to locate the files rangoon.hlp,  raninfo.txt
 and/or ranWWxHH.bmp in the directory of rangoon.exe,  then create
 a private-profile named "rangoon.ini" in  the windows-directory,
 and append the following lines, e.g.:
     [RANGOON]
     About=C:\windows\gameinfo\raninfo.txt
     CardDeck=C:\windows\bitmaps\ran41x55.bmp
     Help=C:\windows\help\rangoon.hlp

This is the Dutch version of the card markings.

If you like using his deck, you might drop him a line.  Better yet,
how about a "lighthouse" post card. :-)
