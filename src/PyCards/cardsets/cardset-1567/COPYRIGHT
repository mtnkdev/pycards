The court cards in this set come from a deck published in France
in the mid 16th century by Pierre Marechal.  The red Jacks are
missing from the only original deck of this type known to exist.
The Jack of clubs was flipped left to right and the pip was changed
to create the Jack of Diamonds.  The Jack of Hearts was created
by flipping the Jack of Spades.  The pip cards were created by
using one pip of each suit from the courts.
