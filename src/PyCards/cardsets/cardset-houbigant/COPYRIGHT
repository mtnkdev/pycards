The courts in this card set were first published in France by
card maker Houbigant around 1818.  An interesting feature of
the original deck is that it included an early form of indexing.
There is a small suit sign in the lower right corner of each
of the courts along with a letter abbreviation of the rank.
This feature was not reproducible at the reduction required to
make the cards usable with PySol.
