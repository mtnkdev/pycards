The images used in this card set were first published in France
around 1760 by card maker Nicolas Conver.  That deck was produced
using wood block molds and stencils.  They were widely copied
by other card makers.  They were republished by the heirs of Mr.
Conver in 1880 using lithography.  These images are from the
1880 deck.
