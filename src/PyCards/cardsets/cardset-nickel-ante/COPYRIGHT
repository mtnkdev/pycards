The court cards in this set were taken from a set of "trade
cards" produced in the United States of America in the late
19th century.  Trade cards were popular during this period
as premiums given away with the purchase of various products.
This set of cards was a transformation deck with images on
the pip cards as well as the courts.  Not all the cards were
available so only the twelve courts have images.
