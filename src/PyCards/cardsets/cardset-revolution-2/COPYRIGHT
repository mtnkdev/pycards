This card set was created using images from a deck published
in France during the revolutionary period in the late 18th
century.  During this period it was dangerous to produce or
even to own anything too closely related to or representative
of royalty.  Actually, you could end up at the wrong end of
the guiotine.  Since card playing was one of the favorite pass
times alternatives to the standard courts had to be found.
This is one such set of alternative court card images.
