This card set was produced using the court images from a deck
published by De La Rue of London in 1880.  Extra pip cards with
eleven, twelve and thirteen pips were added to make this a Hex
A Deck type card set.  The Wizards were taken from a late 19th
century lithograph advertising the lounge in a hotel.
