The four court cards in each suit of this Hex A Deck card set were
published in Czarist Russia sometime around the middle of the nineteenth
century.  They may have been part of a deck used to play a game similar
to Tarok, in which case the Trumps are missing.  Or they may represent
a complete deck that was used to play an entirely different game.
