The courts in this card set were first published in France by
card maker Liege around 1811.  An interesting feature of the
original deck is that it included an early form of indexing.
There is an inverted suit sign in the lower right corner of
each of the courts.  These signs have not been modified from
the original images other than the reduction required to make
them usable with PySol.
