The courts and aces in this card set were published in Frankfurt
Germany around 1864 by card maker C. L. Wust.  The Kings depict
influential citizens of Hamburg Germany of the time.  The Queens
and Jacks are dressed in period costumes.  The Aces show important
buildings in Hamburg.  Card set Hamburg A and Hamburg B use the
same set of images.  The between the two difference is that the
court cards are reversed.
