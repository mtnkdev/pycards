The images used to create the courts for this card set were
taken from a set of "trade cards" published in the United
States of America in the late 19th century.  Cards of this
type were given away as premiums with the purchase of various
products.  The originals were actually part of a "fortune
telling" deck.  The full set consisted of 36 different cards.
